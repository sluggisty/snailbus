Backend service to display system information uploaded by snail-core.

## Overview

Snailbus is a lightweight Go webserver built with Gin that provides a REST API for receiving and displaying system information collected by snail-core. It serves as the central hub for aggregating and managing system diagnostics from multiple hosts.

## Quick Start

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and start the service (includes PostgreSQL)

docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the service
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (clears database)
docker-compose down -v
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Local Development

**Prerequisites:**
- PostgreSQL 16+ running locally
- Go 1.24 or later

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Set database URL (or use default)
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://snail:snail_secret@localhost:5432/snailbus?sslmode=disable"

# Run the server (migrations run automatically on startup)
go run main.go
```

## Database

Snailbus uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage. Database migrations are automatically run on application startup using [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate).

### Migration Files

Migrations are located in the `migrations/` directory:
- `000001_initial_schema.up.sql` - Creates the initial database schema
- `000001_initial_schema.down.sql` - Drops the schema (for rollback)

### Database Schema

The initial schema includes:

- **hosts** table: Stores system information from snail-core agents
  - `host_id` (UUID, PRIMARY KEY): Unique persistent identifier for each host
  - `hostname` (TEXT): Hostname of the system (not unique - multiple hosts can have the same hostname)
  - `received_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ): When the data was received
  - `collection_id` (TEXT): Collection identifier
  - `timestamp` (TEXT): Original timestamp from snail-core
  - `snail_version` (TEXT): Version of snail-core that collected the data
  - `data` (JSONB): Full system information data
  - `errors` (TEXT[]): Any errors encountered during collection

### Manual Migration Management

If you need to manage migrations manually:

```bash
# Install golang-migrate CLI
go install -tags 'postgres' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest

# Create a new migration
migrate create -ext sql -dir migrations -seq add_new_table

# Run migrations up
migrate -path migrations -database "postgres://snail:snail_secret@localhost:5432/snailbus?sslmode=disable" up

# Rollback one migration
migrate -path migrations -database "postgres://snail:snail_secret@localhost:5432/snailbus?sslmode=disable" down 1
```
# Run the server
go run main.go
```

## OpenAPI Specification

Snailbus provides a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all API endpoints. The specification is **automatically generated from code annotations** using [swaggo/swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag), ensuring it always stays in sync with the actual API implementation.

### Accessing the OpenAPI Spec

- **Swagger UI**: `GET /swagger/index.html` - Interactive API documentation
- **JSON format**: `GET /openapi.json` - OpenAPI spec in JSON
- **YAML format**: `GET /openapi.yaml` - OpenAPI spec in YAML

The generated specification files are located in the `docs/` directory (generated by swag).

### Generating the Spec from Code

The OpenAPI specification is generated directly from code annotations in the handlers. To regenerate it:

```bash
# Generate OpenAPI spec from code annotations
make swag

# Or use the command directly
swag init -g main.go -o docs --parseDependency --parseInternal
```

**Note**: You need to install swag first:
```bash
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

The spec is automatically generated from:
- **Handler annotations**: Each handler function has `@Summary`, `@Description`, `@Tags`, `@Param`, `@Success`, `@Failure`, and `@Router` annotations
- **Model annotations**: Data models have `@Description` annotations
- **General API info**: Defined in `main.go` with `@title`, `@version`, `@description`, etc.

### Manual Spec Tools (Legacy)

The project also includes tools for working with manually-edited OpenAPI specs:

```bash
# Build the tools
make install-tools

# Generate JSON from YAML (for manual openapi.yaml)
make generate-json

# Validate the OpenAPI spec
make validate
```

### Viewing the API Documentation

- **Swagger UI**: Visit `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` when the server is running
- **Redoc**: Import the generated `docs/swagger.yaml` or `docs/swagger.json`
- **Postman**: Import the OpenAPI spec to generate a Postman collection

## Architecture

Snailbus is designed to be the central collection point for system information gathered by snail-core agents running on various Linux hosts. The service:

1. Receives diagnostic data from snail-core agents
2. Stores data in PostgreSQL with automatic schema migrations
3. Provides REST API endpoints for querying and displaying system information
4. Monitors database health and connection status
